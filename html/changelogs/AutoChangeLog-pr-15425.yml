  - balance: "Base organ healing rate reduced by 66% (It can still be increased to up to 500% of the base value via sufficient satiety)"
  - bugfix: "Cybernetic organs no longer passively heal damage despite the proc stating they didn't."
  - balance: "Synthetics now gain satiety at sufficient charge (~5 minutes to max satiety from 0)"
