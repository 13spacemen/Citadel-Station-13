changes: 
  - balance: "Stun batons (not police batons/telebatons) no longer knockdown on leftclick."
  - balance: "Stun batons apply a knockdown and tase effect on right click, but once every few seconds (they still don't disarm). They are vulnerable to a shove disarm briefly, however. Standard batons have a cooldown of 5 seconds. Stun prods have a cooldown of 7 seconds."
  - balance: "Taser resistance prevents the knockdown, so any chem that grants this (like adrenals) protects you from this knockdown."
  - balance: "Stun batons apply a stagger when they hit someone, preventing sprinting for a few seconds."
  - balance: "Stun batons respect melee armor for their stamina damage, but their cells, based on max charge, grant armor penetration. For every 1000 charge, they gain 1 armor pen. (Roundstart batons have 15 pen, just fyi)"
  - balance: "Shoves can disarm you of any item, not just guns."
  - bugfix: "Removes a duplicate trait definition for TRAIT_NICE_SHOT."
