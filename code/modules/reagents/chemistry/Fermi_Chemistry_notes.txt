This contains the reaction recipies and thats it.
name, id, results, required_reagents, required_catalysts, mix_message, required_temp
To add: a lot

eg:{
	/datum/chemical_reaction/charcoal
	name = "Charcoal"
	id = "charcoal"
	results = list("charcoal" = 2)
	required_reagents = list("ash" = 1, "sodiumchloride" = 1)
	mix_message = "The mixture yields a fine black powder."
	required_temp = 380
	required_catalysts = list("plasma" = 5)
	}

How the end state should look:{
	/datum/chemical_reaction/bicaridine
    name = "Bicaridine"
    id = "bicaridine"
    results = list("bicaridine" = 3)
    required_reagents = list("carbon" = 1, "oxygen" = 1, "sugar" = 1)
    OptimalTempMin = 350 // Lower area of bell curve for determining heat based rate reations
    OptimalTempMax = 500 // Upper end for above
    ExplodeTemp = 550 //Temperature at which reaction explodes
    OptimalpHMin = 4 // Lowest value of pH determining pH a 1 value for pH based rate reations (Plateu phase)
    OptimalpHMax = 9.5 // Higest value for above
    ReactpHLim = 2 // How far out pH wil react, giving impurity place (Exponential phase)
    //CatalystFact = 0 // How much the catalyst affects the reaction (0 = no catalyst)
    CurveSharp = 4 // How sharp the exponential curve is (to the power of value)
    ThermicConstant = -2.5 //Temperature change per 1u produced
    HIonRelease = 0.01 //pH change per 1u reaction
    RateUpLim = 50 //Optimal/max rate possible if all conditions are perfect
		//optional:
		mix_message = "The mixture yields a fine black powder."
		required_catalysts = list("plasma" = 5)

	edit:
	required_temp = 380

Where the actual reaction takes place, main edit location.
About half way where I've commented (WHY IS THERE NO LINE NUMBERS?!)

Where what the reactions do, the code that sets what they do.
